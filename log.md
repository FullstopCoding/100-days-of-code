# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 21, 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Learned about git/github and how to push/pull/branch/merge/clone/commit/and how to properly comment.  One of my first experiences actively using version control even though I had been introduced to it a while ago.
**Thoughts** Still trying to understand how often I should commit my content.  Unsure if I should create branches of my own code for learning exercises or just commit to my master branch.  Seems reasonable to develop good habits early.

### Day 2: June 22, 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Even though I'm writing this at 11:26pm, I woke up at 5:30am, bright eyed and bushy tailed to begin learning before a long work day.  Spent the am coding jQuery and working on my CSS.  Did some freeCodeCamp tutorials and exercises.  Still breezing through, need to work on my JavaScript.  I also want to check out the Net Ninja's tutorials on what seems to be the MEAN stack.  Also want to get through some of the Bootstrap stuff.  Even though it's straight forward I should be using it more.

### Day 3: June 23, 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Went through freeCodeCamp's first two projects.  "Build a Tribute Page" and "Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage".  Started onto the Basic Javascript tutorials.  Tomorrow I'll be volunteering at a Bike Rodeo, and then at a multicultural festival.  Shift looks to be 12:30pm to 20:00.  I'll wake up early to get some coding time in before I head off to "work".  Also properly configured my laptop to have my git user credentials.

### Day 4: June 24, 2017, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Went through freeCodeCamp's exercises, up to [193] in terms of exercise progress.  Getting ready to go to Bike Rodeo + Multicultural Festival.  Should be home around 21:00, I'll commit in my brain to code again before 24:00.  Began first twitch stream for my coding journey.  Continued on after 20:30, finished up at [216] challenges completed.  Will resume tomorrow!

### Day 5: June 25, 2017, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Went through freeCodeCamp's exercises, up to [230].  Heading out for volunteering from 9:30 to 11:30.  Home for lunch and then more coding later.  Picked up coding again at 12:42 and continued until 19:56.  Completed up to exercise [249].  I'll begin again tomorrow in the AM for a full day of coding!  On vacation this coming week.

### Day 6: June 26, 2017, Monday->Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Went through freeCodeCamp's exercises, up to [263].  Started coding at 07:00.  Took lunch around 14:00.  Ended up streaming until 00:37 on Tuesday.

Total stream uptime of 17~ish hours.  Completed the Random Quote Generator exercise on FCC.  Spent far too much time fighting CodePen trying to figure out why it refused to send my GET requests back on my API calls.  Watched a fantastic video by Stephen Mayeux called "What the heck are APIs, JSON, and AJAX?" that really explained GET requests a lot better, and how to properly structure an ajax request.

I also learned it's important to place https://crossorigin.me/ on the front of my requests for CodePen so they resolve correctly.  I plan on waking up early tomorrow and completing the "Show the Local Weather" challenge.

### Day 7: June 27, 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Began streaming at 07:30.  Working on "Show the Local Weather" project.  Just have to finish the images and clean up the code a bit.  Finished the "Show the Local Weather" project at 10:43 with assistance from my stream (thanks CodingHobby) fixing my somewhat broken JSONP request (case sensitivity matters), as well as apparently you can have too many semicolons when passing them in as variables to a CSS property (don't need 'em! Who knew!).  Took a short break and now going to start coding the Wikipedia viewer!

Finished coding the Wikipedia viewer at around 18:30.  Had dinner, took the wife for ice cream, and now I'm back to coding again until I'm too exhausted to code anymore!

Final update for the day.  Started coding my "Use the TwitchTV JSON API" project.  I got most of the design work done today.  All is left to do is go through tomorrow and update the JavaScript functionality.  Easy task I suppose, but I'm finding with each project I'm completing from start to finish my code is getting a lot cleaner.

There is a big temptation to go back and "fix" my old projects to change them from what they were into what I think they currently should be.  I think maybe at the end I may go through and visit each project with a "2.0" version of it, but still keep the 1.0 for historical reference.  Managed to get a total of 13:30 hours in total stream time today.  Not as much as the 17 hour shift yesterday, but going to bed at 02:00 and waking up at 07:00 to start coding again was maybe a misstep, but I was up...so what else to do but code.

Full night of sleep and hit the stream tomorrow with some more "questionable quality" coding until I get better.  Almost forgot...finished up to exercise [266] of freeCodeCamp!

**Update** to yesterday's comments regarding https://crossorigin.me/.  It was me.  My ajax request had datatype, and not dataType.  case matters!

### Day 8: June 28, 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**:

Today's start is at 08:19.  Going to finish off the TwitchTV JSON API project and move onto the further JavaScript challenges.  Completed the "Use the TwitchTV JSON API" project at 16:07.  Moving onto "Intermediate Algorithm Scripting" exercises.
Benefits of streaming include having users who are able to explain .filter() so even I can understand it.  Shoutout to Junicus for the assist.  Completed up to exercise [269] on freeCodeCamp.  Wanted to get through the "Intermediate Algorithm Scripting"...lofty goals.  Back at it tomorrow in the early hours.  Streamed for 11:13 today!

Note: Need to learn about the A part of AJAX and how to handle responses and store information on the success of a GET request into an array.

### Day 9: June 29, 2017, Thursday->Friday

**Today's Progress**:

Today's start is at 09:48.  Little bit later, but still plan a 12h shift.  Goals for today include getting through the "Intermediate Algorithm Scripting" as far as I can and maybe checking out some videos and reading on some of my terrible CSS.  Have to pick up some new design skills along with all this JavaScript.

The goals of attempting to finish the "Intermediate Algorithm Scripting" challenges were a complete failure.  I've decided to transition into the Beta version of Free Code Camp which focus' slightly more on newer technologies.  I've already upped my CSS game and learned quite a bit about Flexbox by spending far too much time on a much newer "Build a Tribute Page" first project you're given.

Things learned:  Some CSS animation, proper HTML5 tag usage(main, article, section, nav, header, footer, etc), accessibility options (tabindex, links, forms, etc).

Completed up to [173] of the new beta curriculum, and going to continue to focus on this path until I can up my JavaScript game.

Managed to get in a total of 16:30 hours of streaming today.  Long day, and even longer one planned tomorrow.  Tomorrow me has to work on accessibility as well as passing all the test cases for the Tribute page project.

### Day 10: June 30, 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**:

Today's start is at 10:48.  Goals for today include to work on accessibility for the Tribute page as well as passing all the test cases for the Tribute page project.  Finished the "Build a Tribute Page" at 13:10.  Moving on to "Build a Survey Form" challenge.  Finished "Build a Survey Form" at 18:54.

19:16 began work on "Build a Product Landing Page".  Finished up at 03:01 on Saturday.  Managed to get a total of 16:30 hours in streaming today.  Learned quite a bit in terms of improving my CSS skills.  I am more comfortable in terms of using flexbox to position items on the screen.  Trying to use more material design concepts as well in terms of my colours.  I also really enjoy the Google Fonts website.  It gets me what I need really quickly.  Big shoutout to my stream for getting me setup with a ton of advice, assists on code, and generally being awesome.  Was a very productive day once again.

### Day 11: July 1, 2017, Saturday

**Today's Progress**:

Today's start is at 11:07.  Goals for today include finishing the "Build a Technical Documentation Page" as well as the "Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage".  Finished the "Build a Technical Documentation Page" at 20:54.  Taking some time to go watch the Canada Day fireworks for the 150th birthday of my country.  Tomorrow I'll finish off the "Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage" project before having to go back to work for Monday.  Total stream time today was just over 10 hours.  Finished up to [177] of freeCodeCamp.

### Day 12: July 2, 2017, Sunday

**Today's Progress**:

Today's start is at 10:28.  Goals for today include finishing the "Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage". Learned something new today.  When selecting a font on Google Fonts, you can customize it so that you get the Light/Regular/Bold options!  Finished the "Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage" project at 15:37, 9 minutes over the target I had set for myself (left @media queries until the last minute..."I don't need media queries! My page is fully responsive!" - Me). After "receiving" my "Responsive Web Design Certificate" I powered on throughout the rest of the beta freeCodeCamp exercises. Completing the "Beginner JavaScript" and partially completing the ES6 exercises.  Up to [294] of the new beta content and enjoying myself immensely.  Streamed for a total of just over 13 hours.  Completed coding at 23:45.

Total hours streamed:  111.5 since June 24th.  Time to go back to work.

**Notes**

Talk to Quincy about how he told me I'm supposed to use all caps with consts, but in his examples he doesn't have to use CAPS FOR CONSTS.

### Day 13: July 3, 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**:

Today's start is at 19:56.  Finished up the stream at 23:23.  Completed up to freeCodeCamp exercise [307] before finally deciding tha maybe I should find an alternative resource for learning ES6 as a lot of the test cases were passing false positives and it was mostly chat (shoutout to Chewtoy, JUBAN_3, and Junicus for the assists) that was correcting what I even knew was poor code.  I'll have to investigate how I'll continue my learning sometime tomorrow afternoon.

Things learned: this goes up one scope.

### Day 14: July 4, 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**:

Today's start is at 19:41. Finished off the Regex exercises on freeCodeCamp.  Biggest win was being able to pull out trailing whitespaces from stuff.  Finished up with 5 hours of streaming today.  Plan on moving on to "Basic Data Structures" and "Debugging" tomorrow with freeCodeCamp.  Really fearing the "Intermediate Algorithm Challenges" that are coming up, but I'm hoping to improve my JavaScript before I get to that point.  The ES6 portion of the freeCodeCamp beta, although interesting, was giving me false positives on my bad code, and no fault of freeCodeCamp themselves, it's a beta and my expectations should be as such.  Finished up to exercise [339] on freeCodeCamp.

### Day 15: July 5, 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**:

Today's start is at 20:00.  Filling this in on July 6th as I didn't get time to complete on the 5th.  Ended early to get ready for a possible mentor/mentee interview that I have on July 6th under a full stack developer at work.  Meeting at 15:30 to discuss possibility of this opportunity.  Job posting that came out fell in line with my previous skillset at work, and I would like to further develop so that I could join the team in the future.  Completed up to freeCodeCamp exercise [347] in "Basic Data Structures".

### Day 16: July 6, 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress**:

Today's start is at 19:40.  Had an interview today in regards to a mentorship at my company under a Full Stack coder.  It was quite successful and I have a meeting next Wednesday to outline my requirements as well as what I can provide to the team.  It looks as if they'll be getting me setup inside their system so that I can take on some projects.  As it turns out, this is actually a project that I pitched to the company over 10 years ago at a meeting with some project managers who went on to create the project based on my requirements, but I was unfortunately never a part of.  How interesting that it has come full circle.

I got my first "family member" of the stream (aka subscriber) in the user h3xt0sis who has been watching me progress.  Felt pretty good about.

Today's learning came from StarGazer1258.  The dev tools is more than just for inspecting elements of your webpage and also checking out the errors I'm throwing to console, there is a little button at the top which looks like a Phone, which you can look at the mobile view instead of having to go to Sizzy.co, but I still love Sizzy.

This tool is pretty awesome though.  ^5 StarGazer1258.

Completed up to [376] of the beta freeCodeCamp exercises.  Finished the "Debugging", "Basic Data Structures", and started on the "Basic Algorithm Scripting" challenges before I decided to call the stream at 23:30.  Woke up at 04:30 this morning, so it seems like the prudent thing to do.

I was very successful today and look forward to what tomorrow brings!

We also learned of a new tool! CSSmatic, which is great for helping generate some CSS visually.  I mentioned that I enjoy stealing others material design shadows, so this is a link that's provided so I can quickly get the feedback on the visual I'm going for in terms of my drop shadow.  Thanks to StarGazer1258 for the assist on that one!
