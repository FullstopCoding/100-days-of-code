# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 21, 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Learned about git/github and how to push/pull/branch/merge/clone/commit/and how to properly comment.  One of my first experiences actively using version control even though I had been introduced to it a while ago.
**Thoughts** Still trying to understand how often I should commit my content.  Unsure if I should create branches of my own code for learning exercises or just commit to my master branch.  Seems reasonable to develop good habits early.

### Day 2: June 22, 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Even though I'm writing this at 11:26pm, I woke up at 5:30am, bright eyed and bushy tailed to begin learning before a long work day.  Spent the am coding jQuery and working on my CSS.  Did some FreeCodeCamp tutorials and exercises.  Still breezing through, need to work on my JavaScript.  I also want to check out the Net Ninja's tutorials on what seems to be the MEAN stack.  Also want to get through some of the Bootstrap stuff.  Even though it's straight forward I should be using it more.

### Day 3: June 23, 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Went through FreeCodeCamp's first two projects.  "Build a Tribute Page" and "Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage".  Started onto the Basic Javascript tutorials.  Tomorrow I'll be volunteering at a Bike Rodeo, and then at a multicultural festival.  Shift looks to be 12:30pm to 20:00.  I'll wake up early to get some coding time in before I head off to "work".  Also properlyl configured my laptop to have my git user credentials.
