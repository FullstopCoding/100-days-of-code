# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 15, 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I completed building my Hackintosh, Registered my domain at http://www.fullstopcoding.com, created twitter account @FullstopCoding, as well as created a new email address, fullstopcoding(@)gmail.com, and created this GitHub account to begin the journey.

**Thoughts** I fell off the wagon a bit, but I'm back.

### Day 1: June 16, 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Today I started working on a very simple homepage to house more upcoming projects.  Home/About/Projects/Contact.  I had colours picked from the work done yesterday on the logo/twitter, so I'll be using similar colours for the project.  Most work was being done in the CSS, but we are still at early days on the HTML.

**Thoughts** Work consisted of leaving at 08:00 and getting home at 19:00.  Dinner + dishes completed at 20:15.  Started coding at just before 23:00 after prep being done for volunteer work tomorrow.  Need to be up at 05:15 and meeting people at 06:00.  Tomorrow's me is going to curse todays me.  I can catch up on sleep sometime tomorrow!  Consistency is key and can't drop the coding ball too early.

Developed locally, so no links today.  When progress is made, server is setup I'll start linking results.
