# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 21, 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Learned about git/github and how to push/pull/branch/merge/clone/commit/and how to properly comment.  One of my first experiences actively using version control even though I had been introduced to it a while ago.
**Thoughts** Still trying to understand how often I should commit my content.  Unsure if I should create branches of my own code for learning exercises or just commit to my master branch.  Seems reasonable to develop good habits early.

### Day 2: June 22, 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Even though I'm writing this at 11:26pm, I woke up at 5:30am, bright eyed and bushy tailed to begin learning before a long work day.  Spent the am coding jQuery and working on my CSS.  Did some freeCodeCamp tutorials and exercises.  Still breezing through, need to work on my JavaScript.  I also want to check out the Net Ninja's tutorials on what seems to be the MEAN stack.  Also want to get through some of the Bootstrap stuff.  Even though it's straight forward I should be using it more.

### Day 3: June 23, 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Went through freeCodeCamp's first two projects.  "Build a Tribute Page" and "Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage".  Started onto the Basic Javascript tutorials.  Tomorrow I'll be volunteering at a Bike Rodeo, and then at a multicultural festival.  Shift looks to be 12:30pm to 20:00.  I'll wake up early to get some coding time in before I head off to "work".  Also properly configured my laptop to have my git user credentials.

### Day 4: June 24, 2017, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Went through freeCodeCamp's exercises, up to [193] in terms of exercise progress.  Getting ready to go to Bike Rodeo + Multicultural Festival.  Should be home around 21:00, I'll commit in my brain to code again before 24:00.  Began first twitch stream for my coding journey.  Continued on after 20:30, finished up at [216] challenges completed.  Will resume tomorrow!

### Day 5: June 25, 2017, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Went through freeCodeCamp's exercises, up to [230].  Heading out for volunteering from 9:30 to 11:30.  Home for lunch and then more coding later.  Picked up coding again at 12:42 and continued until 19:56.  Completed up to exercise [249].  I'll begin again tomorrow in the AM for a full day of coding!  On vacation this coming week.

### Day 6: June 26, 2017, Monday->Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Went through freeCodeCamp's exercises, up to [263].  Started coding at 07:00.  Took lunch around 14:00.  Ended up streaming until 00:37 on Tuesday.

Total stream uptime of 17~ish hours.  Completed the Random Quote Generator exercise on FCC.  Spent far too much time fighting CodePen trying to figure out why it refused to send my GET requests back on my API calls.  Watched a fantastic video by Stephen Mayeux called "What the heck are APIs, JSON, and AJAX?" that really explained GET requests a lot better, and how to properly structure an ajax request.

I also learned it's important to place https://crossorigin.me/ on the front of my requests for CodePen so they resolve correctly.  I plan on waking up early tomorrow and completing the "Show the Local Weather" challenge.

### Day 7: June 27, 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Began streaming at 07:30.  Working on "Show the Local Weather" project.  Just have to finish the images and clean up the code a bit.  Finished the "Show the Local Weather" project at 10:43 with assistance from my stream (thanks CodingHobby) fixing my somewhat broken JSONP request (case sensitivity matters), as well as apparently you can have too many semicolons when passing them in as variables to a CSS property (don't need 'em! Who knew!).  Took a short break and now going to start coding the Wikipedia viewer!

Finished coding the Wikipedia viewer at around 18:30.  Had dinner, took the wife for ice cream, and now I'm back to coding again until I'm too exhausted to code anymore!

Final update for the day.  Started coding my "Use the TwitchTV JSON API" project.  I got most of the design work done today.  All is left to do is go through tomorrow and update the JavaScript functionality.  Easy task I suppose, but I'm finding with each project I'm completing from start to finish my code is getting a lot cleaner.

There is a big temptation to go back and "fix" my old projects to change them from what they were into what I think they currently should be.  I think maybe at the end I may go through and visit each project with a "2.0" version of it, but still keep the 1.0 for historical reference.  Managed to get a total of 13:30 hours in total stream time today.  Not as much as the 17 hour shift yesterday, but going to bed at 02:00 and waking up at 07:00 to start coding again was maybe a misstep, but I was up...so what else to do but code.

Full night of sleep and hit the stream tomorrow with some more "questionable quality" coding until I get better.  Almost forgot...finished up to exercise [266] of freeCodeCamp!

**Update** to yesterday's comments regarding https://crossorigin.me/.  It was me.  My ajax request had datatype, and not dataType.  case matters!

### Day 8: June 28, 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**:

Today's start is at 08:19.  Going to finish off the TwitchTV JSON API project and move onto the further JavaScript challenges.  Completed the "Use the TwitchTV JSON API" project at 16:07.  Moving onto "Intermediate Algorithm Scripting" exercises.
Benefits of streaming include having users who are able to explain .filter() so even I can understand it.  Shoutout to Junicus for the assist.  Completed up to exercise [269] on freeCodeCamp.  Wanted to get through the "Intermediate Algorithm Scripting"...lofty goals.  Back at it tomorrow in the early hours.  Streamed for 11:13 today!

Note: Need to learn about the A part of AJAX and how to handle responses and store information on the success of a GET request into an array.

### Day 9: June 29, 2017, Thursday->Friday

**Today's Progress**:

Today's start is at 09:48.  Little bit later, but still plan a 12h shift.  Goals for today include getting through the "Intermediate Algorithm Scripting" as far as I can and maybe checking out some videos and reading on some of my terrible CSS.  Have to pick up some new design skills along with all this JavaScript.

The goals of attempting to finish the "Intermediate Algorithm Scripting" challenges were a complete failure.  I've decided to transition into the Beta version of Free Code Camp which focus' slightly more on newer technologies.  I've already upped my CSS game and learned quite a bit about Flexbox by spending far too much time on a much newer "Build a Tribute Page" first project you're given.

Things learned:  Some CSS animation, proper HTML5 tag usage(main, article, section, nav, header, footer, etc), accessibility options (tabindex, links, forms, etc).

Completed up to [173] of the new beta curriculum, and going to continue to focus on this path until I can up my JavaScript game.

Managed to get in a total of 16:30 hours of streaming today.  Long day, and even longer one planned tomorrow.  Tomorrow me has to work on accessibility as well as passing all the test cases for the Tribute page project.

### Day 10: June 30, 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**:

Today's start is at 10:48.  Goals for today include to work on accessibility for the Tribute page as well as passing all the test cases for the Tribute page project.  Finished the "Build a Tribute Page" at 13:10.  Moving on to "Build a Survey Form" challenge.  Finished "Build a Survey Form" at 18:54.

19:16 began work on "Build a Product Landing Page".  Finished up at 03:01 on Saturday.  Managed to get a total of 16:30 hours in streaming today.  Learned quite a bit in terms of improving my CSS skills.  I am more comfortable in terms of using flexbox to position items on the screen.  Trying to use more material design concepts as well in terms of my colours.  I also really enjoy the Google Fonts website.  It gets me what I need really quickly.  Big shoutout to my stream for getting me setup with a ton of advice, assists on code, and generally being awesome.  Was a very productive day once again.

### Day 11: July 1, 2017, Saturday

**Today's Progress**:

Today's start is at 11:07.  Goals for today include finishing the "Build a Technical Documentation Page" as well as the "Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage".  Finished the "Build a Technical Documentation Page" at 20:54.  Taking some time to go watch the Canada Day fireworks for the 150th birthday of my country.  Tomorrow I'll finish off the "Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage" project before having to go back to work for Monday.  Total stream time today was just over 10 hours.  Finished up to [177] of freeCodeCamp.

### Day 12: July 2, 2017, Sunday

**Today's Progress**:

Today's start is at 10:28.  Goals for today include finishing the "Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage". Learned something new today.  When selecting a font on Google Fonts, you can customize it so that you get the Light/Regular/Bold options!  Finished the "Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage" project at 15:37, 9 minutes over the target I had set for myself (left @media queries until the last minute..."I don't need media queries! My page is fully responsive!" - Me). After "receiving" my "Responsive Web Design Certificate" I powered on throughout the rest of the beta freeCodeCamp exercises. Completing the "Beginner JavaScript" and partially completing the ES6 exercises.  Up to [294] of the new beta content and enjoying myself immensely.  Streamed for a total of just over 13 hours.  Completed coding at 23:45.

Total hours streamed:  111.5 since June 24th.  Time to go back to work.

**Notes**

Talk to Quincy about how he told me I'm supposed to use all caps with consts, but in his examples he doesn't have to use CAPS FOR CONSTS.

### Day 13: July 3, 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**:

Today's start is at 19:56.  Finished up the stream at 23:23.  Completed up to freeCodeCamp exercise [307] before finally deciding tha maybe I should find an alternative resource for learning ES6 as a lot of the test cases were passing false positives and it was mostly chat (shoutout to Chewtoy, JUBAN_3, and Junicus for the assists) that was correcting what I even knew was poor code.  I'll have to investigate how I'll continue my learning sometime tomorrow afternoon.

Things learned: this goes up one scope.

### Day 14: July 4, 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**:

Today's start is at 19:41. Finished off the Regex exercises on freeCodeCamp.  Biggest win was being able to pull out trailing whitespaces from stuff.  Finished up with 5 hours of streaming today.  Plan on moving on to "Basic Data Structures" and "Debugging" tomorrow with freeCodeCamp.  Really fearing the "Intermediate Algorithm Challenges" that are coming up, but I'm hoping to improve my JavaScript before I get to that point.  The ES6 portion of the freeCodeCamp beta, although interesting, was giving me false positives on my bad code, and no fault of freeCodeCamp themselves, it's a beta and my expectations should be as such.  Finished up to exercise [339] on freeCodeCamp.

### Day 15: July 5, 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**:

Today's start is at 20:00.  Filling this in on July 6th as I didn't get time to complete on the 5th.  Ended early to get ready for a possible mentor/mentee interview that I have on July 6th under a full stack developer at work.  Meeting at 15:30 to discuss possibility of this opportunity.  Job posting that came out fell in line with my previous skillset at work, and I would like to further develop so that I could join the team in the future.  Completed up to freeCodeCamp exercise [347] in "Basic Data Structures".

### Day 16: July 6, 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress**:

Today's start is at 19:40.  Had an interview today in regards to a mentorship at my company under a Full Stack coder.  It was quite successful and I have a meeting next Wednesday to outline my requirements as well as what I can provide to the team.  It looks as if they'll be getting me setup inside their system so that I can take on some projects.  As it turns out, this is actually a project that I pitched to the company over 10 years ago at a meeting with some project managers who went on to create the project based on my requirements, but I was unfortunately never a part of.  How interesting that it has come full circle.

I got my first "family member" of the stream (aka subscriber) in the user h3xt0sis who has been watching me progress.  Felt pretty good about.

Today's learning came from StarGazer1258.  The dev tools is more than just for inspecting elements of your webpage and also checking out the errors I'm throwing to console, there is a little button at the top which looks like a Phone, which you can look at the mobile view instead of having to go to Sizzy.co, but I still love Sizzy.

This tool is pretty awesome though.  ^5 StarGazer1258.

Completed up to [376] of the beta freeCodeCamp exercises.  Finished the "Debugging", "Basic Data Structures", and started on the "Basic Algorithm Scripting" challenges before I decided to call the stream at 23:30.  Woke up at 04:30 this morning, so it seems like the prudent thing to do.

I was very successful today and look forward to what tomorrow brings!

We also learned of a new tool! CSSmatic, which is great for helping generate some CSS visually.  I mentioned that I enjoy stealing others material design shadows, so this is a link that's provided so I can quickly get the feedback on the visual I'm going for in terms of my drop shadow.  Thanks to StarGazer1258 for the assist on that one!

### Day 17: July 7, 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**:

Today's start is at 19:24.  Worked on practicing my .map() and .filter() yet again.  Still trying to hammer those down, and I'm not sure why they've given me so much trouble.  Even when I understand how they work I still manage to mangle them.

Finished up to exercise [381] of the freeCodeCamp beta.  Total of 4.25 hours streamed today.  I WILL finish the Basic Algorithm Scripting challenges tomorrow, but in the meantime I'm going to get a full night of rest and be fresh for tomorrow to crush the challenges!

### Day 18: July 8, 2017, Saturday

**Today's Progress**:

Today's start is at 07:00.  I've purchased "The Complete JavaScript Course" by Jonas Schmedtmann from Udemy and I'm going to walk through it a bit before I start streaming.  Spent a bit of time doing the course before starting the stream at 09:00.  Need to spend less time streaming and more time understanding the content of what I've already learned.  filtering, mapping, reducing, and just generally reading the content on MDN I can't put into practice when this is the time I need to be doing it.

Used the "Logical NOT(!)" operator today a couple of times to solve some challenges, but it was more googling/assistance of others.  This should be a tool in my toolbox, and it will be going forward, but I need to do more studying so I know when to reach for it.

Getting better at not screwing up my filtering process, but after writing it out, I'm struggling with the "what's actually being returned" portion.  Work in progress.  We'll get better!

Returned back to the core version of freeCodeCamp.  Took on the beta to learn more JavaScript, but it didn't really assist in that capacity, in fact it probably took away more than anything.  I did learn a ton about HTML/CSS/accessibility/Flexbox, etc...but the whole reason I took on the beta was to work on my JS, which seems to be the thing that's coming slowest to me.  I have a few resources for studying, including the course from Jonas Schmedtmann.  Eloquent JavaScript - Second Edition, funfunfunction youtube series, and The Net Ninja's videos as well.  Need to go over that content, make notes, and then do some challenges that use what I've learned.

Total time streamed today 12:00 hours, but 2 hours previous to that studying, so a total of 14 hours today!  Went from [381] to [385] of the freeCodeCamp beta exercises.  Went from [269] to [278] of the freeCodeCamp core exercises.

### Day 19: July 9, 2017, Sunday

**Today's Progress**:

05:00 wakeup today.  Chores + bit of Diablo to relax a bit, and then got started at 07:30 in terms of programming.  Need to spend the day doing review and less code.  Going to consume the content from funfunfunction today!

Day was broken up with other obligations.  Managed to get in around 5 hours of studying before streaming.  Started streaming at
21:10.  Plan on putting in 3 hours before I'm off to bed!

Managed to get 2 hours and 40 minutes in streaming, completed up to [281] of the core freeCodeCamp exercises.  My code for "Spinal Tap Case" is awful, but it works!  Rather pleased because I actually tried to use some odd regular expressions and it worked.  Also completed the "Convert HTML Entities" and I have a rule that after I find a solution that passes the tests at freeCodeCamp I can look at their answers under "hints".  Looked up the "Convert HTML Entities" and mine was actually in line with the "advanced" answer.  Was quite pleased with that.

Tomorrow I'll be working so I'll be starting somewhere between 19:00 and 20:00 EDT.

Worked today on my mapping, regular expressions, and key value pairs.

### Day 20: July 10, 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**:

Stream started at 19:42.  Today I'm back in the mine that is "Intermediate Algorithm Challenges".  Farming that knowledge.  Fell down a mine shaft at "Smallest Common Multiples" and now I have to go research math problems I avoided in high school.  Skipped the exercise "for now" as I felt I was getting carried a little too hard by my viewers and I need to invest some time offline to understand the problem more thoroughly.  Continued on and completed the "Drop It" challenge, but decided to call the stream at 00:00.  Managed to complete up to [284] of freeCodeCamp.  Will do some research on "Euclidean algorithm" against my better judgement.  I only have this week in terms of being able to finish the JavaScript challenges.  Next week I plan on dedicating entirely to Node.js in anticipation of the NodeSchool Workshop at Shopify in Toronto on July 22.  Met a lot of new people on stream today, which was great.  Always nice to see new people.  Was handed a great blog about someone in my exact position.

### Day 21: July 11, 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**:

Stream started at 18:38 as I got home from work earlier than expected.  Excited to get back to it so may as well just jump right in!  Benefits of having a stream.  1) Friendly people 2) Friendly people that will drag you kicking and screaming to the understanding of how reduce and recursion work together.  Junicus with the big assist today.

Using what I learned in regards to recursion and working on my knowledge of reduce I was able to get through the rest of the "Intermediate Algorithm Challenges".  Yesterday I was introduced to "Euclidean algorithm", and luckily I didn't have to do much more today than implement the code on finding the GCD and LCM into a reduce!  I completed up to [289] of freeCodeCamp.  Today was the 1000th day of freeCodeCamp being live, and I noticed that on the page they list the following:

Established: 1,000days ago
More than 6,000 campers have gotten their first developer jobs.
More than 8,000 experienced developers have gotten even better developer jobs.

Certificates:
Front End: 5,870 earned
Data Viz: 782 earned
Back End: 510 earned
All three: 325 earned

I set my personal goal to be "326" of finishing all three.  Enjoying what I'm learning so far, logging a lot of hours and I'm really looking forward to not doing logic puzzles and getting back to building things.  I wish there was a bit of a break between the "Intermediate Algorithm Challenges" and the Advanced, but alas I need to continue on before I go onto the "Advanced Front End Development Projects".  Completed today with a total of 4 hours 45 minutes of streaming.  Looking forward to tomorrow and powering through the "Advanced Algorithm Challenges"!  Completed up to freeCodeCamp exercise [289].

**Notes**

Need to spend more time working on recursion.  I get it but I don't get it.

### Day 22: July 12, 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**:

Stream started at 20:57.  Late start but I had some things to take care of after work as well as getting out of work late, but we're back at it again.  Mining that knowledge.  Worked on the "Validate US Telephone Numbers" for a bit before deciding that tonight wasn't the night for regular expressions.  I then updated my versions of node/npm, went on over to the freeCodeCamp beta, and tried to do some of the "APIs and Microservices" challenges, but ran into some technical issues with the "Glitch" website.  Still beta, so I can't complain too much...reasonably though I was just setting up the initial JSON file to define the dependencies and setting up the author/description/etc.

We didn't learn a lot of new things, but I got to practice my Github commands a bit more, so that was a win.  I learned how to clone a repo, then delete the git folder/files from my computer to then push up to my remote as a new master :)

Today will be a better day in terms of learning.  I need to setup a clear path for my next round of learning.  My choices are finish off the "Advanced Algorithm Challenges" and then move onto the advanced projects, or prep for NodeSchool next week (July 22).  I don't want to go there with no knowledge and just spend 3 hours "learning" how to do the basic things that I can learn at home.  I'd rather leverage the opportunity to network a little and learn some new things!

Also forgot to update the freeCodeCamp progress for yesterday that I had completed up to [289].  No FCC progress today unfortunately!

### Day 23: July 13, 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress**:

Today's start is at 20:42.  Late start second day in a row, but I have some direction on what I want to do.  I'm starting with some of the backend courses at freeCodeCamp and I'll be working on using node with c9.io as well as the NodeSchool exercises.  Finished the first 3 exercises of the "learnyounode" course.  It was a bit of a slog because using a new environment and understanding how items are brought in as inputs, outputs, etc.  One of my chat members, 85filter, managed to pass along another great resource with a ton of items on different items for learning to be a developer.  The funny part is, some of the items I really like for things I've learned that I like to pass off as one of my own great resources are already on this list, and they're at the top of the list, so it's very promising!

Update on my first meeting with my mentor.  Didn't go as well or maybe it went better than it should have.  The person I was setup under told me that I had already surpassed them in terms of their knowledge, so I have to reach out to some other teams to see if I can find a mentorship that fits.

### Day 24: July 14, 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**:

Late start today at 22:30.  Full intentions of starting earlier, but when I got home today I was greeted by a yellow lab puppy.  I spent a few hours bonding with him before I headed downstairs to get my nerd workout in.  Great news, my email to Mr. Wes Bos was "finally" replied to.  I have permission to play his videos on stream!  If only I didn't email him the day he went on vacation :)

I also got another lead on working with a developer at work, and maybe a potential opportunity to go work with the IoT team on some of their projects.  We'll see...the team needs a bit of a budget and more projects, but it's a good lead!

Managed to get through most of the "how-to-npm" course before I had to go and attend to Scout again.  Managed to stream for 1.5 hours, but took in quite a bit of npm.

### Day 25: July 15, 2017, Saturday

**Today's Progress**:

Very late start, but busy in the personal life and 23:00 start is better than no start at all!

Managed to code until 00:22.  Only got in ~1.5 hours of coding/streaming after a long day.  I have some more time tomorrow before I have to head out (12:00) and then I'm arriving home late again.  Node is interesting...it's a lot "tougher" but only because it's all new to me, so I'm going through the trial and error of "does this work?" and "does this pass through to the console?".  So I have to check a lot more where my code is failing, and the new interactions especially with the async calls.


### Day 26: July 16, 2017, Sunday

**Today's Progress**:

Early start today.  08:30 after waking up at 07:00 and taking care of a few responsibilities.  I'm in the market for a laptop for coding.  I'm stuck between buying a piece of garbage I'll hate and it'll be $400, but it's the practical solution for how much I'll probably use it, and spending far too much on something I may not be using full time.  I ended up coding until 11:30 am.  There was 2 days of funeral activities this weekend, so the lack of coding was a result of this.  I'm going to be attending NodeSchool on Saturday the 22nd, so I'm going to be focusing on doing Node work next week!

### Day 27: July 17, 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**:

Start today is 20:45.  Starting a little later, but as long as I get in before 21:00 I can get in 3 hours a night, which is my goal!  Today I'll be focusing on Node.js as NodeSchool is coming up on July 22nd, 2017!

Managed to make it to 21:47 before I have to head off...completed Exercise 5 of the "learnyounode" program.  Falling asleep at the keyboard is not a good look for me.  I'll get a full nights rest and maybe an early start before work tomorrow!  Potential interview this week as HR contacted me to apply for a new (developer related) position at work after my mentorship "didn't work out".  Turns out I may just be fit for another department in which I can grow.

### Day 28: July 18, 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**:

Completely off the mark, but I found out something pretty awesome.  I was thinking my CSS chops were okay, but then I ran into [this](http://gedd.ski/build/overwatch-hero-picker/).  It made me think that I should just pull out a screenshot and start working on a CSS overlay for some things for practice.  Today I didn't stream, but I worked on The Web Developer Bootcamp Udemy course by Colt Steele.  Can't stream the content without permission, but sometimes I have to decide between streaming and learning!  I put in under 2 hours today, the sleep schedule has been destroyed and in a couple more weeks I'm back on vacation so I'll be able to put in some crazy hours learning again.  Looking forward to that time.

### Day 29: July 19, 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**:

Going to be working on the Node videos offered by The Net Ninja.  I won't be streaming today as I don't want to restream something I don't have access to but I need to get a little more Node under my belt before I go to Toronto on Saturday!  Today's start was at 21:00.  Hoping I got enough rest for a full 3 hours tonight!  Drinking coffee at this hour isn't bad, is it?

Ended at around 23:00 studying.  Stayed up until 02:00.  Coffee was a bad idea.  Writing this on the 20th.
