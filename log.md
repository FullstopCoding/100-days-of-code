# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 15, 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I completed building my Hackintosh, Registered my domain at http://www.fullstopcoding.com, created twitter account @FullstopCoding, as well as created a new email address, fullstopcoding(@)gmail.com, and created this GitHub account to begin the journey.

**Thoughts** I fell off the wagon a bit, but I'm back.
